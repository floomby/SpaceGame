## Space IO Game

A simple multiplayer game where you have a ship and do things.

### Random list of things to do

- Shields? (maybe)
- Mines
- Trade
- NPCs
- Handle network interruptions
- Network optimization
- Defining units, missiles, effects, etc should be easier
- Economy is very boring right now

### MMO Stuff

- Play as guest (low priority)
- Option to change password (low priority)

### Steps to get to the minimal game loop

- Collectables (dropping spare parts)
- Repairing station
- Purchasing at station list
- Checkpoint fixing if station allegiance changes
- Teams no longer in def
- NPC Ships to fight
- Home station or stations
- Sector bounds and global map
- Asteroid mineral regeneration

### Things I really should have

- Engines (no warp by default, but can purchase)
- Sensors (max range) - also I should redo the target arrows in the hud somewhat
