## Space IO Game

A simple multiplayer game where you have a ship and do things.

### TODO

- Tooltips
- Keyboard control summary
- Guided weapons
- Station UI
- Add an abstraction over the nested index lookup for sprites within definitions for missiles and effects (it is error prone as it is now)
- Collectables
- Shields? (maybe)
- Mines
- Trade
- Proper targeting for stations
- NPCs
- Handle network interruptions
- Network optimization

### List for first alpha

- Station explosions
- Confederation station
- Win condition
- Server state refresh on game completion
- Improve asteroids
