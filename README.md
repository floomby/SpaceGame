## Space IO Game

A simple multiplayer game where you have a ship and do things.

### TODO

- Guided weapons
- Add an abstraction over the nested index lookup for sprites within definitions for missiles and effects (it is error prone as it is now)
- Collectables
- Shields? (maybe)
- Mines
- Trade
- Proper targeting for stations
- NPCs
- Handle network interruptions
- Network optimization

### Next version steps

- Sound effects
- Missile launch graphic effect
- Look at how the networking works and how to improve it
- Ship view in station UI
- Guided missiles
- Proper station targeting
