## Space IO Game

A simple multiplayer game where you have a ship and do things.

### TODO

- Shields? (maybe)
- Mines
- Trade
- NPCs
- Handle network interruptions
- Network optimization
- Defining units, missiles, effects, etc should be easier
- Economy is very boring right now

### MMO Stuff

- Play as guest (low priority)
- Option to change password (low priority)
- Repairing stations

### Next next version steps

- Point to target key
- Collectables
- Killed/kill message with names
- Ability to dump cargo
