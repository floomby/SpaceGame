## Space IO Game

A simple multiplayer game where you have a ship and do things.

### TODO

- Shields? (maybe)
- Mines
- Trade
- NPCs
- Handle network interruptions
- Network optimization
- Defining units, missiles, effects, etc should be easier
- Economy is very boring right now

### More stuff to do

- Finish dialog refactoring (finishing for station dialogs is somewhat more complex than settings and map)
- Find and fix the absolute anchor speed bug

### MMO Stuff

- Play as guest (low priority)
- Option to change password (low priority)
- Repairing stations
- Think about trade and the economy

### Next next version steps

- Point to target key
- Collectables
- Killed/kill message with names
- Ability to dump cargo
