### Random list of things to do

- Shields? (maybe)
- Mines
- Trade
- NPCs
- Handle network interruptions
- Network optimizations
- Economy is very boring right now
- Try and make the strafe animations work in a way that looks tolerable

### MMO Stuff

- Play as guest (low priority)
- Option to change password (low priority)

### Steps to get to the minimal game loop

- Siege npcs and default station allegiance
- Cargo dialog

### Things I really should have

- Engines (no warp by default, but can purchase)
- Sensors (max range) - also I should redo the target arrows in the hud somewhat
