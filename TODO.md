### Things to think about

- Shields?
- Handle network interruptions
- Network optimizations
- Economy does not make sense
- Try and make the strafe animations work in a way that looks tolerable?
- Manufacturing slots and time??
- Armament purchase options for stations??
- Killed/killed by messages??

### Refactoring stuff

- Make mine drawing not this ad-hoc thing it is right now (probably model after the projectile drawing)
- Investigate drawing performance (Missile trails are still bad)

### 3d Things I have bypassed fixing

- Health and energy bars in both the world and the target display are incorrect (they are almost identical to fix)
